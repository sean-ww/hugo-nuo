Hugo Nuo Theme Edit
===================

This is a hugo blog template based on the [Hugo Nuo theme](https://github.com/laozhu/hugo-nuo).

The Changes:
* The menu has been removed from the template to support only posts and no additional pages.
* Syntax highlighting added
* The avatar is now also a home link
* The social menu has been moved to always display below the subtitle
* Markdown can be displayed in summary content in conjunction with the ```<!--more-->``` tag
* Share links added for each post, with a new tweet variable to define tweet text
